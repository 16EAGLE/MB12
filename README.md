The MB12 research project investigates how things can be calculated from other things using R. Read some nonsense below that has been copy-pasted soley for the purpose of filling up this document.

## Abstract

The body of your abstract begins here. It should be an explicit summary of your presentation that states the problem, the methods used, and the major results and conclusions. Do not include scientific symbols, acronyms, numbers, bullets or lists in the abstract. It should be single-spaced in 10-point Times New Roman.   The first part of your abstract should state the problem you set out to solveorthe issue you set out to explore and explain your rationale for pursuing the project. The problem or issue might be a research question, a gap in critical attention to a text, a societal concern, etc. The purpose of your study is to solve this problem and/or add to your discipline’s understanding of the issue. This section of the abstract should explain how you went about solving the problem or exploring the issue you identified. Your abstract should also describe the research methods; this section should include a concise description of the process by which you conducted your research. Next, your abstract should list the resultsoroutcomes of the work you have done so far. If your project is not yet complete, you may still include preliminary results or your hypotheses about what those results will be. Finally, your abstract should close with a statement of the project’s implications and contributions to its field. It should convince readers that the project is interesting, valuable, and worth investigating further. In particular, it should convince conference registrants to attend your presentation.  These directions are written in the format required for the abstract of the paper for the Center for Scholastic Inquiry’s International Academic Research Conferences. We recommend that you download these directions as a MS Word document and use it as the template for your abstract as it contains all necessary formats and styles. The content of the abstract will be the basis for acceptance of the paper presentation at the international research conference. The abstracts will be peer reviewed and authors will be informed about acceptance for presentation via email. Be sure to adhere to the word limitation for the abstract (250 words). 

## What is Lorem Ipsum?

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisici elit, sed eiusmod tempor incidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequat. Quis aute iure reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint obcaecat cupiditat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

## Why do we use it?

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‚Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‚lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

## Where does it come from?

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of „de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, „Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from „de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

## Where can I get some?

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don’t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn’t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
